    <h1><center>What is an ARDUINO?</center></h1>
    <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, </b>ba finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.</p>
